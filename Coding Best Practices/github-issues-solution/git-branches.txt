# working with branches git/github

1. create a branch
git branch <name_branch>

2. show all branches
git branch -a

3. switch btn branches
git checkout <name_branch>

4. delete merged branch
git branch -d <name_branch>

5. delete unmerged branch
git branch -D <name_branch>

6. create & switch to a create branch
git checkout -b <name_branch>

7. merging branch to main branch
- first you need to be in the branch you want to merge into
git merge <name_branch_merged_in>

8. push branch
git push origin <name_branch>

9. clone project with all branches
To clone a GitHub repository along with all its branches, use the following command:
git clone --mirror <repository-url>

OR

Alternatively, if you want to clone the repository normally (not as a mirror) and access all branches locally:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
git fetch --all

ISSUE CLONE:
Check all remote branches
git branch -r

If the branch exists on the remote but isn't set up locally, check it out:
git checkout <name_branch>
